# Kepler 452-B Post Quantum Cryptography for Deep Space Applications

#### Once quantum computers exist, there is a risk of creating chaos by losing all the services, which depends on the current security primitives we are dealing with in securing the data communications such as nuclear power plants, satellite communications, etc. As NIST announced, the need to have a set of cryptographic primitives to resist the existence of the Shor algorithm, which can break the conventional crypto primitives. The team is planning to deliver a new dynamic reconfigurable processor to secure space devices against quantum attacks, which can be used to support the ARTEMIS program activities.
